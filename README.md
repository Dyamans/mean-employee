# MeanEmployee

# Welcome to the mean stack
The mean stack is intended to provide a simple and fun starting point for fullstack javascript applications.
MEAN is a set of Open Source components that together, provide an end-to-end framework for building dynamic web applications; starting from the top (code running in the browser) to the bottom (database). The stack is made up of:

MongoDB : Document database – used by your back-end application to store its data as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) documents
Express (sometimes referred to as Express.js): Back-end web application framework running on top of Node.js
Angular (formerly Angular.js): Front-end web app framework; runs your JavaScript code in the user's browser, allowing your application UI to be dynamic
Node.js : JavaScript runtime environment – lets you implement your application back-end in JavaScript

# Pre-requisites
git - Installation guide .
node.js - Download page .
npm - comes with node or download yarn - Download page .
mongodb - Download page .

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Node server
Run `npm run start:server` in another command. This server is running in the port 3000.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
